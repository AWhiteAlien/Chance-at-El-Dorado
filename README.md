# Chance at El Dorado – Lost Amazonian Civilization Theory

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project explores the possibility that the Lago Rogaguado basin in Bolivia may conceal the buried remains of a lost ceremonial city or engineered settlement. Built with GPT-4, open-source satellite tools, and mythic decoding, this theory was developed for the **OpenAI to Z Challenge**.

Our core claim: this basin may not just be a lake—it may be a forgotten hydraulic hub, collapsed under water pressure and time, preserved only in satellite scars and festival myth. Maybe El Dorado's Gold was actually water.

## 🧭 How This Started
I began using ChatGPT heavily and saw an ad for the OpenAI to Z Challenge. I thought: *that looks fun.*

While exploring the Amazon in Google Earth Street View, I stumbled on the **Boi-Bumbá floats**—giant bulls, spirits, and serpent-themed processions in Brazil. That lit the spark.

I wandered the basin, found **Lago Rogaguado**, and remote viewed (RV'd) a city sinking or flooding in the lake’s center. It *felt* too specific. So I teamed up with my AI assistant, Kattara, and built this theory step-by-step—using pattern recognition, myth tracking, satellite review, and Canva visual builds.

Along the way, I stumbled across another team’s work confirming **paleo rivers and engineered earthworks** nearby. That sealed the direction. We refined everything, rebuilt the packet, and you're looking at the result.

## 🌿 Why It Matters
Myths are memory. The Amazon may still whisper the shape of cities long lost to flood and time. This is a theory, not a claim. But it’s a strong enough signal to earn attention.

We call on future researchers to scan this region with LIDAR, bathymetry, and indigenous collaboration. Let's find out if the jungle remembers.
