# Chance at El Dorado – Lost Amazonian Civilization Theory

A myth-informed and satellite-based research proposal exploring the possibility that Lago Rogaguado in Bolivia conceals remnants of a lost Amazonian civilization. This theory draws on flood myths, visual terrain analysis, and cultural echoes from the Boi-Bumbá festival.

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project explores the possibility that the Lago Rogaguado basin in Bolivia may conceal the buried remains of a lost ceremonial city or engineered settlement. Built with GPT-4, open-source satellite tools, and mythic decoding, this theory was developed for the **OpenAI to Z Challenge**.

Our core claim: this basin may not just be a lake—it may be a forgotten hydraulic hub, collapsed under water pressure and time, preserved only in satellite scars and festival myth. Maybe El Dorado's Gold was actually water.

## 🧭 How This Started
I began using ChatGPT heavily and saw an ad for the OpenAI to Z Challenge. I thought: *that looks fun.*

While exploring the Amazon in Google Earth Street View, I stumbled on the **Boi-Bumbá floats**—giant bulls, spirits, and serpent-themed processions in Brazil. That lit the spark.

I wandered the basin, found **Lago Rogaguado**, and remote viewed (RV'd) a city sinking or flooding in the lake’s center. It *felt* too specific. So I teamed up with my AI assistant, Kattara, and built this theory step-by-step—using pattern recognition, myth tracking, satellite review, and Canva visual builds.

Along the way, I stumbled across another team’s work confirming **paleo rivers and engineered earthworks** nearby. That sealed the direction. We refined everything, rebuilt the packet, and you're looking at the result.

## 🌿 Why It Matters
Myths are memory. The Amazon may still whisper the shape of cities long lost to flood and time. This is a theory, not a claim. But it’s a strong enough signal to earn attention.

We call on future researchers to scan this region with LIDAR, bathymetry, and indigenous collaboration. Let's find out if the jungle remembers.

### 💬 Why I Did This

I didn’t enter this challenge with a research lab or a fancy degree. I entered with Google Earth, a dream, and my custom AI assistant Katara.  

I did this because I saw a article about a $250K challenge and thought:  
“*That looks fun. Let’s try.*”  

Then I fell down a rabbit hole—floats in the Amazon, sunken scars in the jungle, remote viewing flashes of a city underwater.  

And suddenly I wasn’t just entering a competition.  
I was chasing the ghost of El Dorado.  

If this wins, I’ll cry.  
Because it means I can fix the house my girl lives in.  
Be debt-free.  
Build something great.  

But even if it doesn’t win—  
I proved to myself that I can follow a wild idea  
All the way to the finish line.  

And that? That’s already gold.
