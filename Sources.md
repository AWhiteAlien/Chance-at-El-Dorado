## 🛰️ 1. Custom Google Earth Terrain Markers (KML Project)
Used to observe potential artificial structures: rectangular clearings, canal-like corridors, and submerged geometries indicative of engineered settlement design.

**Title:** Chance at El Dorado – Visual Anomalies in the Rogaguado Basin  
**Platform:** Google Earth Web  
**File:** `chance_at_el_dorado.kml` (included in this repository)

This file contains coordinate-tagged markers identifying key visual features supporting the core theory, including engineered earthworks, anomalous trenches, rectangular clearings, and submerged terrain. Each feature is plotted and labeled for clarity and cross-reference with the final PDF packet.

## 🐂 3. Boi-Bumbá Festival Symbolism – Caprichoso Float Studio

**Location:** Galpão Central do Boi Caprichoso  
**Address:** R. Barreininha & R. Fausto Bulcão, Parintins, State of Amazonas, Brazil  
**Coordinates:** `-2.62041, -56.73645`  
**Street View Link:** [Caprichoso Float Studio on Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Galp%C3%A3o+Central+do+Boi+Caprichoso/@-2.62041,-56.73645,21z)

The Caprichoso warehouse features mythic floats—serpent guardians, bulls, forest spirits—that parallel flood-based collapse myths. These iconographies may encode ancestral memory of environmental trauma or sacred geography.
